BBC Worldservice Podcast Downloader
--------------------------------------------

Download and play famous BBC World Service podcasts.

The app has been written by me - the programmer - without any commercial interest and is meant to be useful for anyone who likes to listen to the "BBC World Service" programs.

Publisher of content: BBC World Service https://www.bbc.co.uk

Update May 23:

I have withdrawn the app from F-Droid app store, (it is still there as an archived version) as it got marked with a so called "anti feature" for "promote or depend entirely on a Non-Free network service", which for me is unjustified and not acceptable.

However, the app can be downloaded here:
