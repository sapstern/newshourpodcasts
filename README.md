BBC Worldservice Media Manager
--------------------------------------------

Download and play BBC World Service podcasts.

Listen to BBC Worldservice radio program. This is pretty beta version (02/24).

The app has been written by me - the programmer - without any commercial interest and is meant to be useful for anyone who likes to listen to the "BBC World Service" programs.

Publisher of content: BBC World Service https://www.bbc.co.uk

The app comes free, but as always, you are at your own risk in using it.

The license I have published it under is <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">APACHE LICENSE, VERSION 2.0</a>

Update May 23:

I have withdrawn the app from F-Droid app store, as it got marked with a so called "anti feature" for "promote or depend entirely on a Non-Free network service", which for me is unjustified and not acceptable. (If BBC programs are non free, what is...)

The app can be downloaded here:
