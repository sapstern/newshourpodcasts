        <p><strong>Update Version 1.4.4 from 04 2023</strong></p><br/>
        <br/>I am now working on a live program player for live listening to BBC World Service Radio.
        <br/>This feature is in early beta stage, do not expect it to work correctly.
        <br/>

        <p><strong>First time application start</strong></p><br/>
 On first time application start the app displays the settings screen.<br/>
 <br/><img src="./images/settings.jpeg" alt="settings"/><br/><br/>
<strong>You have the following options:<br/><br/>
- Download in background:</strong> Switch this on if you whish the app to try to download all current podcast episodes in background as long as the device is on wifi.
<br/><br/>
<strong>- Download quality:</strong> Select lower (approx 22 MB/podcast), or higher (approx 44 MB/podcast).
<br/><br/>
<strong>- Total Commander (TC) app installed:</strong> This is a file management app which I do like. 
It comes together with a media player, so that it can be used for playing the podcasts as well.
 If TC is installed, then it will be used as the app of choice for file management (under the options menu).
<br/><br/><br/>
<strong>- Keep podcasts forever:</strong> If this option is enabled, downloaded podcasts will not be deleted, otherwise downloaded podcast files will be deleted after 30 days.
(If you uninstall the app, then the downloaded podcasts will all be deleted as well).
<br/><br/><br/>
<strong>- Download directory:</strong> If an external sd data card is present, then you can switch the download directory to that place.
<br/><br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
<strong>- Allow server redirects:</strong> Depending on your location (inside/outside UK) it might be that the server redirects to another url for downloading.
(Outside UK BBC incorporates some commercial ads in their podcasts which then seem to be provided by a non BBC server).
 Generally this should be ok, but every server redirect is a potential security risk.
 That is why I have chosen to give you a dedicated option to enable this.
 (By default it is disabled)
<br/><br/><br/>
<strong>You will be asked to allow the app to access the storage space of the device.</strong>
<br/><br/><br/><img src="./images/allow.jpeg" alt="allow"/><br/><br/>
The app will not function if you deny access to the storage.
<br/><br/>
 <strong>The main screen displays a list of downloadable or already downloaded podcasts.</strong><br/>
 <br/><img src="./images/list.jpeg" alt="list"/><br/><br/>
If a podcast has already been downloaded, then it appears in green color,otherwise red.
 One tip in the left column starts either the download(color red), or playing the podcast (color green).
 For playing the podcast, the player of choice can be used.
<br/><br/><br/><img src="./images/play.jpeg" alt="play"/><br/><br/>

        There is a menu on top of the screen for switching between different programs.
        <br/><br/><br/><img src="./images/program_menu.jpeg" alt="play"/><br/><br/>

In the top right corner of the screen is another menu for starting a file manager (might be necessary to install a suitable filemanager e.g. Total Commander app),
 accessing the settings, documentation, about page as well as the open source licenses of the used libraries.
 <br/><br/><br/><img src="./images/menue.jpeg" alt="menue"/><br/><br/>
	The downloaded podcasts are stored relative to the data root folder of the app.
	Each podcast has a size of approx 22 MB (44 if you choose higher download quality). 
	<br/>On my device this is the folder <strong>"/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/org.mfri.bbcworldservicenewshourdownloader/files"</strong>.
    <br/>The actual podcasts are then stored in a subfolder according to their program name, so far: newshour/sportsworld/sportshour/businessdaily/globalnews
    <br/>It is a good idea to remove all downloaded podcasts from time to time in order to save storage space and to avoid a filled up storage.

        <br/><br/><strong>I hope you enjoy using the app!</strong>
